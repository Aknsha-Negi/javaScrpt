// A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.
Rewrite sumPrimes so it returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to num.

function isPrime(n){
  let count = 0;
  for(let i = 2; i <= n/2; i++){
    if(n % i === 0){
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

function sumPrimes(num) {
  let sum = 0, i = 2;
  while(true){
    if(isPrime(i)){
      if(i > num){
        return sum
      }
        sum += i;
    }
    i++;
  }
}

console.log(sumPrimes(977));
